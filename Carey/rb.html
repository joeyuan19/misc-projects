Not really any injuries his entire career which is a huge, huge plus and puts him over Le'veon who has had character and injury issues</td>

Still worth the risk as the 3rd RB taken off the board as there is a drop off in the next tier of RB's</td>

He had a really good 2nd half of 2016 and I would bet on him in 2017 as a low RB1</td>
