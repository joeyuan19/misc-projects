	Big Board	QB	RB	WR	TE	K	DEF
	Rd. Grade	Rank	Name	Team	Team Role	Notes	Links
Big Board	1	1	Ezekiel Elliott	DAL	1	The cream of the crop. Easily the number 1 pick in my opinion, although Le'veon is a very close second. With Zeke you get ultimate security. He's the ultimate 3 down RB with a legendary O-line. Not really any injuries his entire career which is a huge, huge plus and puts him over Le'veon who has had character and injury issues	
QB	1	1	Le'veon Bell	PIT	1	Easily the 2nd best player in the draft. You’re getting a guy with an extremely high ceiling and high floor. Falls second only to Zeke. Depends on schedule	
RB	1	3	David Johnson	ARI	1	Had he not broken his leg at the very end of last year, he's in the same class as Zeke and Le'veon. I personally don't know what to expect of him coming back from this although I would bet that the chance that he's as good as he was last year is about 65%. Still worth the risk as the 3rd RB taken off the board as there is a drop off in the next tier of RB's	
WR	2.5	4	Demarco Murray	TEN	1	Love his talent and scheme, but I wonder if Derrick Henry will get more touches next year. Still worth a low RB1 valuation	
TE	1	5	Marshawn Lynch	OAK	1	Arguably the biggest question mark in this draft. Coming into a fantastic fantasy situation. The uncertainty lies in his personal performance though. At worst, he's a starting RB for an offense that can move the ball and a defense that will at the least keep them in nearly every game	http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000812024/article/running-back-relocations-which-veteran-additions-will-thrive
K	2	6	Lesean McCoy	BUF	1	Add OL in 2 rd draft. I love Shady but he's a year older and still has been injury prone. For me he's a fringe RB1/2 due to his sleight frame and abundance of questions around the rest of the Bills	
DEF	1	7	Leonard Fournette	JAC	1	Very dependent on O-line whether he's good or great, Jags drafted Cam Robinson(huge plus). YAC will be unbelievable, best RB talent since AP. He's been underrated somehow but this guy has exceptional speed, power, and surprising agility, cuts, and vision. Look for him to have a big rookie campaign	
		8	Doug Martin	TB	2	Good offense, seems to have a good line. Out first 3 games though	
	1	9	Jordan Howard	CHI	1	One of the safer RB picks. This guy broods professionalism and has knack for getting yards. The Bears quietly have a good offensive line with plenty of other weapons to ease the pressure off of Howard. Probably not a third down back due to drafting of Tarik Cohen. Bears defense will be questionable as well and could damage his value	
	2	10	Melvin Gordon	SD	1	Could be a steal- couldn't have asked for a better draft regarding the Chargers'  offensive line. Arguably got the two best guards in the draft, opposite side of that is that 2 starters on his line will be rookies but I think it improves Melvin's value. He had a really good 2nd half of 2016 and I would bet on him in 2017 as a low RB1	
	2	11	Jay Ajayi	MIA	1	Think he'll have a similar year to last year	
		12	Devonta Freeman	ATL	2		
	2.5	13	Todd Gurley	LA	1	New coach "this season should resemble his rookie season more". If you can get this guy in the 3rd as an RB2, you could be well on your way to still playing in January	
		13	LeGarrette Blount	PHI	2	What's the system? Ryan Matthews?	
		14	Lamar Miller	HOU	2	Another questionable player this year. Expected him to have a big year given the volume that the Texans gave him but he relatively underwhelmed. In response, the Texans drafted D'Onta Foreman (RB). I'd prefer the value of drafting a guy like D'Onta Foreman very late in the draft rather than drafting Lamar in the top 6 rounds. Could have a bounce back year though	
		15	Adrian Peterson	NO	1.5	"All Day". It'll be interesting to see how he fits on a Drew Brees team. Team also has Mark Ingram and drafted Alvin Kamara (RB) in 3rd round. My guess is that he'll average 12-15 carries a game, about 85 yards, and 1 TD. Risky RB1, Pretty good RB2.	
		17	Tevin Coleman	ATL	2.3		
		18	Dalvin Cook	MIN	2	Add technically advanced C in draft	
		18	Derrick Henry	TEN	3	Project him as Latavius Murray talent wise, playing behind demarco, pretty good line/philosophy	
		15	Eddie Lacy	SEA	3		
		19	Joe Mixon	CIN	2		
		25	Christian McCaffrey	CAR	2	PASS     .     How does Curtis Samuel affect him? CAR adds OL in rd 2. The 7th overall pick in the draft should be a great talent in the NFL due to his exceptional vision, footwork, and receiving abilities combined with decent speed. The question is where do you take him? For those who love his tape, he's probably a mid-to-high RB2, if you aren't sold on him exceling day 1, he's a great flex option and RB3	
		28	Kareem Hunt	KC	3	Next Le'veon Bell. Reid said Ware learned how to play a full season- is hunt better? Must scout Ware more	
		21	Isaiah Crowell	CLE	2.5	Improved line. Should be similar to last year	
		22	Carlos Hyde	SF	2.5	Drafted joe Williams, talented back	
		25	Thomas Rawls	SEA	2.5		
		27	Kenneth Dixon	BAL	2.5	John Harbough loves everything about him and expects him to be a top back in the league. Rookie last year. BAL added possible starting G in draft	
		28	Latavius Murray	MIN	3	Add technically advanced C in draft	
		29	D'Onta Foreman	HOU	3.5	3rd rd pick. Could easily overtake starter job mid season, if nont earlier	
		30	Samaje Perine	WAS	4	Crowded backfield	
		31	Joe Williams	SF	4	4th rd pick-Great athlete, could be good pick to replace injured Carlos Hyde	
		32	Marlon Mack	IND	4	Very athletic but not very technical	
		37	Jaquizz Rogers	TB	5	Starter for first 3 games(probably). I like his backup's potential a little more (Peyton Barber), but he'll probably have the coaches trust	
		40	James Conner	PIT	5	Great talent but where will he be on depth chart?	
		50	Peyton Barber	TB	5	Like his talent a lot- maybe can overtake Jaquizz Rogers eventually but for right now the clear #3. Worth a last round pick but can probably get him on waivers	
		51	Tarik Cohen	CHI	4	Human Joystick- PR/KR & 3rd down value; Jack's going to take him in the last round	
		60	Chris Ivory	JAC	5.5	Don’t expect him to get the ball a lot more(coach)	
		150	Donnel Pumphrey	PHI	FA	late 4th rd pick	
		150	Jeremy McNichols	TB	FA	He sucks. Peyton Barber is better. DM is out 3 games	
			Wayne Gallman	NYG	3.75	Late 4th rd pick	
			Jamaal Williams	GB	4.5
