	Rd Grade	Rank	Name	Team	WR ?	Notes	Links	
	1	1	Mike Evans	TB	1	Had a fantastic year last year; extremely consistent. My guess is he has another great year with Jameis' trust, however, Desean Jackson and OJ Howard added		
	1	2	Odell Beckham	NYG	1	Arguably the most elusive player in the NFL right now. Knocks against him: Good Eli or bad Eli?, Giants add a lot of talent on offense (Evan Engram(TE), Brandon Marshall) and have a pretty good defense suggesting a more run heavy offense than years previous		
	1	3	Julio Jones	ATL	1	Great system and prior production, however, usually has injury issues. Regression to the mean would suggest he has a slightly worse 2017 campaign		
	1	4	AJ Green	CIN	1	Great talent		
	2	5	Jordy Nelson	GB	1	"White Chocolate". How can you bet against Arod's top WR? I can't. Worry about age getting to him though. Can't debate those numbers he put up second half of 2016 coming off an ACL though		
	2	6	Michael Thomas	NO	1	No reason he shouldn't have just as good a year		
	2	7	Antonio Brown	PIT	1	I think he's a great player but in a terrible system for fantasy production. He's gotarguably a better big play threat (Martavis Bryant) to compete with as well as one of the draft's best possesion receivers (Juju Smith-Schuster), as well as one of the best rushing offenses in the NFL. Don't get me wrong though, Antonio will produce, just maybe won't be the best WR		
	2.5	8	DeAndre Hopkins	HOU	1	Mike Williams for deshaun		
		9	Martavis Bryant	PIT	1.25	Coming back bigger and stronger (link to youtube). The uncertainty keeps him out of contention for early round 2 but late round 2 and round 3 is where he should be valued. One of the fastest and most elusive receivers in the league with the ball in his hand. Big Ben is one of the best and most frequent deep ball qb's.		
	3.5	10	Dez Bryant	DAL	1	Dak had a pretty good rookie year. As teams gear up and allocate more of their defense to stopping Zeke and the boys, look for Dez to step up with more big plays in the secondary		
	3.5	11	TY Hilton	IND	1.5	Big question mark for me. Colts didn't really address their terrible line concerns and he didn’t have a stellar year last year. I see most of the same from TY		
	3	12	Alshon Jeffery	PHI	2	INJURIES. This could be a great fit for Alshon, however, his ability to stay healthy for a season is concerning. Could be a WR1 though considering Wentz is a pretty good young qb likely to get better next year		
	3	13	Keenan Allen	SD	2			
	4	14	Doug Baldwin	SEA	2	Gamer. This guy is TOUGH. Is he worth a WR1? Maybe, but could be enormously worth it as a WR2. Personally I'd rather have him as my WR2 rather than WR1		
	5.5	15	Allen Robinson	JAC	2	All depends on Bortles (who changed his throwing motion this offseason). I'd take a chance on him in rounds 3-5 depending on how much you believe in him and Bortles. If you're bold to take him with RB, QB heavy team as your WR1 that could be a league winning move considering he was much better in 2015		
	5	16	Amari Cooper	OAK	2	This guy has elite footwork. Thing is that he's had that since his rookie season, the problem is he's also got the Crab on his team. Carr coming off broken leg		
	6.5	17	Brandin Cooks	NE	3	Patriots traded their 1st round pick for this guy, they're going to use him. Not sure how it works out with Edelman but I'm guessing an average of 6.5 catches for 80 yards with 0-2 td's every game. Low WR2, good flex		
	7	18	Sammy Watkins	BUF	2.5	Been injured all day every day		
	5	18	Michael Crabtree	OAK	2	Decent value as WR2. You pretty much know what you're going to get with the Crab		
	6	19	Emmanuel Sanders	DEN	3			
	3	20	Terrell Pryor	WAS	2	Could be a decent sleeper. Had a great year last year but still feel as though he's underrated. Now he's got a good qb, and not on the Browns. If you can get him as a WR2 in the 5th you got yourself a steal		
	6	21	Demaryius Thomas	DEN	3			
	7	22	Julian Edelman	NE	3	Brandin Cooks trade has to hurt him a bit, low flex to me		
	7	23	John Ross	CIN	3.5	This is a tough evaluation. Injury issues, AJ Green, Tyler Boyd, Tyler Eifert, Joe Mixon, Gio Bernard. Maybe a late season flier		
	5.5	24	Mike Williams	SD	3	7th overall pick- lot of mouths to feed in offense		
	6.5	25	Corey Davis	TEN	2.5	Coming off injury, big receiver with good route running and hands. Me thinks Mariota will like him very much. A bit rich for a WR2 but potentially a steal as your flex		
	8	26	Kelvin Benjamin	CAR	3.5	Whoknows with this guy? Fluctuates from season to season, flashes big potential but then falls back to Earth. Worth a WR3/4		
	5	27	Davante Adams	GB	2	Huge boom or bust every week. To me that makes him less valuable, but still worth a flex week to week		
	3.5	28	Tyreek Hill	KC	2	Should get you good yardage every week, shot at return td's.  RB/QB heavy draft he could be worth a WR1 due to his high floor but likely a good/great WR2		
	5.5	29	Larry Fitzgerald	ARI	3	Classic Larry. Should continue to do the same
